#Carduino

Carduino is the first project from the team that created the Openlab, an open-source oriented laboratory in the Dpt. of Electronics Computer Systems Engineering at Technological Education Institute of Piraeus. It is a smartphone controled (previously) radio controlled car.

##The main idea

The idea came in the early days of Openlab when we mainly wanted to explore the possibilities of the Arduino and to connect it with our Android smartphones and build something cool to play with.

##Developing the software and hardware

So, we began building the hardware and the software of the remote control car. In a week we had a first draft of the project with $5 car and a ugly looking Android app. 

The experiment had worked and it was out in the open. We took a more expensive car and this time tried to apply the lessons we had learned during the building of the prototype. 

After a month or so, rebuilding and tweaking the project from the beginning we had a full working car with a new improved Android app featuring a comprehensive and joyfull (yet simple) user interface to play with.

##Credits

The hardware was designed and printed on PCB by Herc Trapierakis.

The Arduino code was written by Herc Trapierakis and Phil Georgantas

The Android app was developed by Evaggelos Avgerinos and the user interface was designed and developed by Dimitris Tsironis.

The whole Openlab team debugged and tweaked the project.
